# ultimate-ttt-game
Code for an Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game which was a project in one of my CS classes. 
There are obviously easier ways to doing this but I wanted to enhance the code that we had worked on in the class with OOP concepts.

-Created a game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe of the user against AI using OOP concepts in Java

-Displayed game board, possible moves, and selected move for each player with Eclipse as IDE

-Ensured valid inputs from user
